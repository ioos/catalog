## Service Monitor Overview ##

The [IOOS Service Monitor](https://monitor.ioos.us) harvests from the CKAN
catalog instance and determines whether the datasets referenced by the catalog
are online and running. The service monitor fetches data from the CKAN API, and
then runs a number of checks to determine whether the service is running.
