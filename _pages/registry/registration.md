## Registering Data Sources for IOOS Catalog ##
The Harvest Registry is the entry point for publishing your data sets and services in the IOOS Catalog.  The Registry maintains a list of web-accessible folders (WAFs) from which the Catalog will harvest ISO 19115-2 compatible XML metadata records.  

The process to add your metadata is simple.  Request an account here: [https://registry.ioos.us/users/new/](https://registry.ioos.us/users/new), providing your information as well as an organization affiliation.  Once your account and affiliation is approved, you'll be emailed a confirmation link to activate your account.

Once logged on to the Registry, modify or add any additional WAFs you'd like to publish for your organization.  Once a new WAF is registered, the IOOS Catalog CKAN website will automatically trigger a harvest to read your metadata and add your datasets and services to its inventory.  Your data will be shortly be available via the Catalog.  

You can also manually trigger a re-harvest of an existing WAF from the Registry.  Just click on the 'Reharvest' button from the Data Source detail page.
